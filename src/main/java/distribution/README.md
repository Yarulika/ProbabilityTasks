task #2 for the probability distribution:

do the following 1000 times:
toss a coin (aka generate a random number 0 or 1)
if it's heads (so... for instance 1) toss it again. and if it's heads again, toss it again until eventually it's tails
display the percentages of all the length strikes like
tails after 1 time(s): 50%
tails after 2 time(s): 25%
tails after 3 time(s): 10%
tails after 4 time(s): 5%
and so on...
note that it is kinda random what is the max number of tosses after which you will get tails
so keeping those values in an array isn't the way to go
